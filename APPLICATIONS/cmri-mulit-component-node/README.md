## CMRI CONFIGURATION IN PANEL PRO
```
CMRI PanelPro. When it is running click on edit preferences to get the following window

set the following tabs

System manufacturer = C/MRI

System connection = Serial

Setting

Serial port: (select the port your arduino is connected to, you will find this on the arduino IDE)

Connection Prefix: C

Connection Name: (what ever you want to call it)

Also click on additional connection box and select the Baud rate to 9600 bps

```

## configure the nodes so click on "Configure C/MRI nodes"
```
panel pro -> prefrences -> connection -> click on addition configration ->  add nodes 

click on add node 
provide the node address bases on arduino stetch 
Example below 
 #define CMRI_ADDR 1

in Node Address (UA) textbox 
Node Type: SMINI 

 after providing above information click on "addd node" and then click on "done"
 then click on save and restart the panel pro 

```

## Configure the Sensor

![img](https://github.com/adarshkumarsingh83/jmri-cmri/blob/main/APPLICATIONS/cmri-mulit-component-node/SENSORS-COFIG.png)

```
Open Panel pro 
tools -> table -> sensors ->  
click on "add" sensor button 
   Systemn Connection : C/MRI 
   Hardware Address : 1001 // based on Arduino sketch 
   User Name : provide any information 

   Click on "Create" Button 


   click on sensors window on top menu Defaults -> Initial Sensor state -> provide inactive in open popup window and -> click on "ok" button 


NOTE : In Arduino code address for the sensor will start from 0 but in jmri it will start from 1 
Example: 
cmri.set_bit(0, xxx);
1st param is sensor address and 2nd is the value we cant to send to jmri 
but while configuringg the sensor will start the address by 1001 in which 1000 is arduino address and 1 is the sensor address 

## INFRARED SENSOR BASED BLOCK SENSOR 
5 blocks with IR sensors address from 1001 to 1005 
    10001 for 1st block 
    1002 for 2nd block 
    1003 for 3rd block 
    1004 for 4th block 
    1005 for 5 block 
```

## Panel pro Configuration 

![img](https://github.com/adarshkumarsingh83/jmri-cmri/blob/main/APPLICATIONS/cmri-mulit-component-node/panel-pro-layouteditor.png)

```
NOTE 
for adding => click on the main top then click on shif key then place the selected component on layout editor 
for moving => the component on Layout editor we have to use "command key " and then  select and move on desire place on editor 
for delete => righ clik on component and click on delete 
for rotate => right click and select rotate by xxx angel 


Click on Panel Pro window then top menu -> Panel -> New Panel -> Layout Editor 

1. click on RH right hand turnout and select the "Name" of the turnout and press the shift key and leave on the editor it will create a Right Hand turn out 
2. click on LH left hand turnout and select the "Name" of the turnout and press the shift key and leave on the editor it will create a Left Hand turn out 
  double cliek on turnout and select the rotate and then do it by 180 digree then both the RH and LH will come face to face then click on "command" 
  key and increae the length of the turn out of both RH and LH 
  once click on the buble of the turn out servo moter will change its position 
3. then select the track segment from top then press shif key then join the anchor point of the LH and RH turnouts and for every track segment 
  select the "BLOCK NAME" and "Block SEnsor Name" from the avaliable dropdown and it must be unique for every segment of the track with sensors on it 
4.Click on "Anchor Point" Radio Button then press "Shit key" than do click on the editor we can see the start point is visible on the editor 
  do the same for end point of the track 
  Click on the "Track Segment" radio button then check "Mainline" and "Dashed" check button then  Block Name select the sensor name which we created earlier 
  click on "Highlight" Checkbox and "Block Sensor" Name select from drop down sensor which we have created earlier 
  then keep pressing "shift key" and select the point start and drag to the point end track light will apper 
  then test the sensor by moving hand on the top of them and in editor track will turn into red 

5. click on the Signal Head Icon and add it the layout editor for the turnout 
  slect the signal and right clik on signal icon and then select the "edit logic" and add the logic 
   procted sensor select the sensor for the block 
   and select the turnot name on the drop down  
   now when ever the turnout is change the signal light will also change accordingly 

then save the editor by CRT+ S and provide the name to that and select the location where we want to save the layout information 

NOTE do the abo ve action for all the blocks in the arduino
