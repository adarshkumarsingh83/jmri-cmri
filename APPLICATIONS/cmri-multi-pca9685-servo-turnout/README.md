```

soldering address calculation 
------------------------------------
1 + A5    A4    A3    A2    A1   A0
    32    16    8      4    2     1
------------------------------------

by deafult if nothings is solded then it will be 1 + 0 = 1 board 
AO 1st position from right is solded then it will be 1+1 = 2 board 
A1 2nd position from right is solded then it will be 2+1 = 3 board 
A0 and A1 1st and 2nd from right is solded then it will be 2+1+1 = 4 board 
...... and so on 

NOTE see the soldering chart above
