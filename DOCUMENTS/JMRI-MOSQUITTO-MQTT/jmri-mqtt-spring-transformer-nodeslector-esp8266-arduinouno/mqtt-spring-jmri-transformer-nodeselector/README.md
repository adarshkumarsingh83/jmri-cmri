# JMRI MQTT DATA TRANSFORMER NODE SELECTOR APPLICATION 

> Jmri will push the data to the mqtt 
> transformer application configured with nodes and its details like no of turnout, no of signals, no of light in the node
> transformer application will read the data from mqtt topics which is pushed by jmri and transform that data 
> and push back to the mqtt node wise, also store in end points cache if enabled for serving data via rest endpoints   
> topics for each esp8266 node will have only relevant data only 
> this will reduce the processing on the esp8266 so that it can handle node specific data properly.

### To build this application 
* $ mnvn clean package 

### To Run this application 
* $ mvn spring-boot:run 

### To Run Executable jar of application 
* $ java -jar ./target/amt-jmri-mqtt-transformer.jar

### To pass the customized configuration file 
* $ java -jar ./target/amt-jmri-mqtt-transformer.jar --spring.config.location=classpath:/application.properties,classpath:/application.yaml

## TO ENABLE JMRI MQTT DATA ENDPOINTS 
> ENABLE THE PROPERTIES in  src/main/resources/application.properties
```
# for enabling the endpoints data 
amt.mqtt.transform.endpoints.enabled=true

# storage cache capacity for the enpoints 
amt.mqtt.transform.endpoints.store.size=50

# to combine the output of the 3 aspect signal into one payload 
amt.three.output.signal.joiner=true
```

### TO ACCESS THE MQTT DATA VIA END POINTS 
> curl -X GET http://localhost:8090/amt/node/[nodeId]
* curl -X GET http://localhost:8090/amt/node/1


## TO ENABLE THE PUBLISHING BACK TO THE MQTT
